This is the source code for the IdentityServer configured for the workshop.
It is entirely based on https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3.

The Host is by default hosted at: https://localhost:44333/core (a basic UI is available).

There are some hardcoded users, in this sample: alice and bob (their passwords are similar with name).
There are also some hardcoded clients, scopes ans scopes.
